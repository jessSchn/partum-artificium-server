# The configuration file consists of sections, led by a [section] header and
# followed by name: value entries, with continuations in the style of RFC 822
# (see section 3.1.1, “LONG HEADER FIELDS”); name=value is also accepted. Note
# that leading whitespace is removed from values. The optional values can
# contain format strings which refer to other values in the same section, or
# values in a special DEFAULT section. Additional defaults can be provided on
# initialization and retrieval. Lines beginning with '#' or ';' are ignored and
# may be used to provide comments.
